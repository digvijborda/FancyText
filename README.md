# pyfont

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A python font converter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module is completely open-source and i would appreciate any ideas for the future of this module and/or any bugs you may encouter while using pyfont.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Install:
1) Clone/download the zip from this GitHub 
2) Extract the files from the zip folder to a set path 
3) Copy the path of the folder within the folder which should be now called something along the lines of pyfont-master 
4) Go onto cmd and type the command ‘cd PASTETHEPATHHERE’ 
5) Then type ‘python setup.py install’ OR ‘py setup.py install’ in some cases. 
6) It will then begin to download 
7) Once finished, you may now call the module anywhere by using the import command ‘from pyfont import pyfont’

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Usage:
1) Importing - from pyfont import pyfont 
2) Converting text into copy/paste fonts - pyfont.pyfont.convert(“TEXT”, “FONT_TYPE”) 
3) COMING-SOON - Converting text into copy/paste ascii art - pyfont.pyfont.convert_ascii(“TEXT”, “ASCII_FONT_TYPE”)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Notes:
1) I understand this may be accomplished via webscraping modules e.g BeautifulSoup - and i did try, but as the font converting websites didn’t contain args for text/fonttypes, i decided to use this method, if you have any suggestions on using an alternative method such as webscraping and can help me understand it, i would very much appreciate it. 
2) More commands/fonts WILL be coming soon 
3) All tools can be used freely, either commercially or privately
Look at the tools file for implementation of pyfont in other applications other than standard python.
